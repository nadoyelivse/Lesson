Lost out, beat up,
Dancin' down there,
I found you somewhere out,
Right 'round there, right right there.
Lost and beat up,
Down there dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there.
Lost, and found out,
Daddy found out
How you turned out, how you turned out.
If mama knew now,
How you turned out, you too wild,
You too wild, you too wild,
You too wild, I need you now,
Got to love you,
Found you, found you
Right now, right now,
Right now, right now.
If your mama, knew how
You turned out, you too wild,
You too wild, you too wild,
You too wild, and I need you now.
Lost in my doubt.
Lost out, beat up,
Dancin' down there,
I found you somewhere out,
Right 'round there, right right there.
Lost and beat up,
Down there dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Тебя где-то там,
Right down there, right 'round there.
Lost, and found out,
Turn out, how you thought.
Daddy found out,
How you turned out, how you turned out.
If mama knew now,
How you turned out,
How you turned out, you too wild,
You too wild, you too wild,
You too wild, I need you now,
Love you,
Found you, found you
Right now, right now,
Right now, right now.
If your mama, knew now
How you turned out,
You too wild,
You too wild, you too wild,
You too wild, and I need you now.
Lost and found now.
You too wild,
You too wild, you too wild,
You too wild, and I need you now.
Lost and found now."Took a chance, rolled the dice on me and you"
